\section{The Language of Juiciness}

One of the most important asepcts of designing an experiment around POOP-SNOOP is measuring ``juiciness". The language of ``juicy" design doesn't coincide with players vocabulary. The question, ``is this game juicy?" might invoke some good guesses, but it is not perfect. Without knowledge of their difference, players probably would not discern between the experience of the game and the game itself. But again, is the game what should be measured? If games specifically create experiences, should be both sepearating them? 

The concept of juiciness is defined by the experience created while playing the game. Atanasov \cite{atanasov} states that a juicy experience could be defined as plentiful ``positive emotional feedback", but those words are charged with implications and may skew the results if players were specifically asked about them.

While interviewing players, they understandably found it difficult to describe their emotional state. Intstead, they answered questions about physical conditions of the game. Interviewees pointed out specific aspects they liked whether the smoothness of the interface, the way the chevrons highlighted and bounced, or the flourishes of the background animations. While these emotions can be aligned positive or negative per effect, the overall emotional response is more difficult to analyze.

Putting our game in the hemisphere of citizen science can give a context for our definition of ``positive emotional feedback". In citizen science games, players should feel motivated and encouraged to continue solving puzzles. Asking a player if they would continue playing POOP-SNOOP is not the same measurement as real citizens playing POOP-SNOOP. Because of the nature of my prototype, users were not given the ability to pursue more puzzles. We have sufficiently answered the question that with regards to citizen science games, juiciness can have a substantial impact on player attentiveness.

\section{Juiciness and Game Feel}

Collecting data about playing POOP-SNOOP has demonstrated that ``juicy" is only part of a larger feeling of gamefulness. Like game feel suggests, mechanics play an important role in the quality of a game. Players are susceptible to juiciness' influence while learning about the mechanics of a game, as those who played the ``juicy" tutorial have demonstrated, but there were still plenty of players who mentioned confusion after completing the game. Did their confusion inhibit their ability to answer the survey questions correctly? Would they have been able to answer the survey if they were confused? In this situtation, those results were utilized because there was a tendency for players of the ``juicy" version to be confused less. The experiment shows those those who played the ``juicy" version potentially learned the game better. The goal of ``juiciness" is only to reinforce the mechanics and physicicalilty of the game, but if players cannot understand those concepts, measuring their sense of experiencing ``juiciness" could potentially be misleading.

\subsection{Juiciness and POOP-SNOOP}

Several aspects of playability in POOP-SNOOP potentially interfered with the user's willingness to reflect on subtleties that were not playable aspects. For instance, when the introductory puzzle interrupted a player's freedom, did they take that into account when the measured ``enjoyment"? Enjoyment, interest, and difficulty are not a strictly ``juicy" measurment nor is POOP-SNOOP a perfect example of ``juicy" and ``juiceless" design.

Because some users of the ``juiceless" version praised the clean layout, it's worth mentioning that there may have been extra ``juicy" effects in the ``juiceless" version. By definition, the ``juiceless" version should be a version of the game that has very little design incorporated. While the earlier definition only applies to effects, particles, sounds which are all easily grouped, where does overall design fit in this model?

For instance, the design of the grid was such that it did not resemeble the original spreadsheet that POOP-SNOOP once resided in. Should the ``juiceless" version of POOP-SNOOP reflected that nature? Did incorporating a simple grid structure break my definition of ``juiciness" or is that design part of the fundamental design of the game that cannot be manipulated. By measuring different version of POOP-SNOOP, the consequences of extraneous effects were observed to be as extraneous as possible. Some design challenges that could have been categorized as ``juicy" were included in both versions to isolate the measurement of ``juiciness."

Too much polish is distracting because it makes it difficult to wrap your brain around the physical sensation being conveyed \cite{swink2009game}. Contrast those with little puffs of smoke that come up as Mario slides his feet around. Those are great because they are easy to make sense of. But when every single object sprays stuff everywhere, how does that reconcile with the experience of physical reality?

In contrast, the harmonization of polish and mechanics utilizes effects to support the single impression of physicality \cite{swink2009game}. In a puzzle game, the physicality isn't as obvious as game with the intension of immersion. The phsyical metaphor for this game is weak which limited possible ``juicy" design as well as augmenting some basic physical metaphor with ``juicy" design. As more polish is added, game designers must be careful that their methods do not override the basic game design techniques.
